# WebShop – Django & React Course Project

This project is a full-stack **web shop web application** developed as part of a university course project.  
The goal of the project is to design and implement a functional webshop using **Django (backend)** and **React (frontend)**, following a set of predefined functional and technical requirements.

The application allows users to browse items for sale, create an account, log in, sell items, and purchase items from other users. The backend exposes a REST API built with **Django REST Framework**, while the frontend is implemented as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React.

## Key features (work in progress)
- Django backend with SQLite database
- REST API for webshop functionality
- User registration and authentication
- Item listing with status handling (on sale / sold)
- Foundation for cart and purchase logic
- React frontend consuming the API

## Project structure
- `backend/` – Django backend (API, models, authentication)
- `frontend/` – React frontend
- `README.md` – Project description and setup instructions

## Purpose
This project is primarily **educational** and focuses on:
- understanding full-stack architecture
- working with REST APIs
- connecting a React frontend to a Django backend
- applying good project structure and development practices

The project is was originally started on my school account, but I decided to import the still **work in progress** code to my main account.

More functionality will be added as the project progresses.
